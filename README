Coffeed is a OpenWRT daemon server to control your espresso machine's temperature via a PID algorithm.

This is a OpenWRT package that will build an app binary that will be installable on OpenWRT routers.

What is required is a router with OpenWRT firmware with the proper GPIO, i2C and PWM installed kernel options.

It runs as a daemon and can be talked to over the network via the coffeec clients (iPhone, cli, Mac etc...)

You need to build a circuit board to mount the different i2c chips and the transistor to actually interface a
thermocouple and a SSR. Plans of which I hopefully made available. 

GPO addresses are available in the configuration file if you're not using the default numbers.

TODO:
- Auto tuning
- Better PID algorithm
